    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with eggs, 
        hard cheese, cured pork, and black pepper.</p> 
    <p>The dish arrived at its modern form, with its current name, in the middle of the 20th century. 
    <p>The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano, or a combination of the two.</p>
    <p>No cream. Ever.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400g Fettucini</li>
        <li>6 Egg Yolks</li>
        <li>300g Streaky Bacon</li>
        <li>75g Pecorino</li>
        <li>75g Parmesan</li>
        <li>6 Cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>1-2 Cups of Pasta Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take a bowl, and grate in your Parmesan + Pecorino (set a pinch aside for sprinkling at the end).</li>
        <li>Then add the 6 egg yolks, and a very, very generous amount of black pepper, 4 or 5 pinches of it. A good carbonara is meant to be peppery. Whisk everything together and set aside</li>
        <li>Chop your bacon into little bits and add to a frying pan</li>
        <li>As they begin to brown, add your spaghetti to a pan of boiling water. Salt the boiling water, pasta water is meant to be almost as salty as the sea!</li>
        <li>Once the bacon is crisp, add 2 cloves of sliced garlic. Allow these to soften, if the garlic or bacon looks like it is catching on a pan, add small spoons of the starchy pasta water.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is 1 minute before being ready, so still quite al dente, take out 5 or 6 ladles of the pasta water and pour it into a bowl. Set this bowl aside.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta, and then pour the pasta into the pan with the bacon and the garlic. Add a couple ladles of the pasta water, and cook everything together over a medium heat. Once the water has evaporated and the pasta is nice and silky, take off the heat.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool down for 1 minute, and then add the egg and parmesan mixture, and another ladle of the water and mix it all together.</li>
        <li>If it looks too thick, add a bit more water. It should be silky smooth! Serve with a sprinkle of parmesan and twist or two more of black pepper! Enjoy!</li>
